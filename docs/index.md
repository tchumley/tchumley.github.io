I am an Associate Professor of Mathematics at [Mount Holyoke College][MHC].  Previously, I was an NSF Alliance for Building Faculty Diversity Postdoctoral Fellow at [Iowa State University][ISU].  Before that, I got my PhD in mathematics at [Washington University in St. Louis][WU]. See my [cv][] for more details.


## Research

I'm interested in probability theory, stochastic processes, and their applications.  In the past few years I've worked on problems that overlap with billiard dynamical systems, differential geometry, and statistical physics.    


#### Students

<!-- <img style="float: right;" src="assets/img/karen-young-me.jpg" width=125px class="img-responsive"> -->

-	In Fall 2021, I worked with Emily Rosaci and Yuxuan (Susan) Wang, continuing their work from Summer 2021. 
	They created an interactive [Shiny app on random billiards][].
-	In Summer 2021, I worked with Ruozhen Gong, Emily Rosaci, and Yuxuan (Susan) Wang on a 
	project involving billiards, probability, and their interplay.
	Our main objects of study were polygonal billiard tables and some related Markov chains. 
	Their work was written up in a [report][ESR].
-	In Spring 2021, I worked with Ruozhen Gong on the relationship between
random billiard models and thermodynamics. Her work is documented in this
[summary report][Ruozhen Gong].
-	In Spring 2019, I worked with Nicole Andrews on Hidden Markov models related to random billiards. Her work is documented in this [write-up][Nicole Andrews].
-	In Fall 2018, I worked with Ziyan (Jessica) Feng on random polygonal billiards. Some of her work is documented on this [web page][Jessica Feng web].
-	In Summer 2017, I worked with Qiran (Karen) Dong and Fanyi (Young) Yang (Mount Holyoke), on a project studying random billiard systems with non-holonomic (rolling) constraints.  Here is their [talk][Karen Young talk]. 
-	In 2016, I worked with Tianle (Jeff) Yang (Iowa State) on a project studying the Lorentz gas model with random scatterer collisions.

-	I was interviewed by the [AMS Mathematical Moments][] program about my research
	on billiards and thermodynamics.
-	I am honored to have appeared in the [Lathisms 2020 calendar][]. I was also featured in an [MAA Focus article](http://digitaleditions.walsworthprintgroup.com/publication/?m=7656&i=677122&p=46) 
	about Lathisms.
-	The image above is a visualization of my [Math genealogy][].

-	Mount Holyoke math/stat student [summer activities][].
-	An [MCMC demonstration](https://tchumley.shinyapps.io/cryptography/) for crytography that I made for talk.
-	Some notes that I've written for myself on [getting started with swarm2][], the high performance computing cluster at UMass.
