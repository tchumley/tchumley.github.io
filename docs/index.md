## Announcements ##

Announcements will be posted on the [Course Announcements Moodle forum][] throughout the semester,
but essentially all other materials will be posted on this page.


## Syllabus ##

Check the [syllabus][] for all the important class policies (grades, attendance, etc.).


## Homework ##

There will be weekly homework assignments throughout the semester to be turned in.
Please read these [guidelines][] for writing in our class.

- **Webwork**. Some of your homework will be done in an online system called Webwork.
	*	These problems will be due on **Wednesdays**.
	*	You'll have unlimited attempts at each problem.
- **Written work**. A selection of problems will be assigned to be written up individually and turned in each week.
	*   These problems will also be due **Wednesdays**.
	*	You may work with others but the writing should be done on your own.
- **Gradescope**. Homework will be turned in through [Gradescope][].
	*	Please add yourself to the Gradescope course using Entry Code **TBA**.
	*	Gradescope has made a [short tutorial][] on submitting homework.
- **Collaboration**. I want you to work together on the homework, of course on the
	group assignments but even on the solo assignments. 
	The process of explaining your ideas to one another really helps in learning math. 
	However, you must write up the solo assignments on your own and avoid copying others' work directly. 
	Also, please only write what you understand so that I know where to help, and
	please avoid using online forums like Math StackExchange, solutions manuals, or similar resources.
	A huge part of learning in this class comes from figuring out how to get unstuck
	by spending time thinking on your own or talking to me and classmates; these other
	resources can end up being counter-productive in the long term.
- **Rewrites**. Homework is for practice, and you are not expected to write perfect answers from the start! 
	*	Your revisions will be due on **Fridays**. Please resubmit (only the problems you're revising) on Gradescope.
	*	For some problems it's difficult to allow redo's fairly, 
		so on occasion I might not allow a problem to be redone.
	
	
  
Assignment							Due			
--------------------				-----		
[Homework 0](hw0.pdf)				TBA
[Homework 1](hw1.pdf)				TBA



## Quizzes ##

There will be (mostly) weekly quizzes that will be given on Fridays.
The purpose of these is to check in to see that you're comfortable with fundamental material
and homework problems. Problems will always be related to the previous week's homework and class topics.

Quiz         	 			Date	     		Material
------------ 				-------- 			------------
Quiz 1						TBA					TBA

  

## Exams ##

There will be two midterms and a final.  The dates for the mid-terms are subject to change slightly.

Exam 2							TBA			TBA						TBA			
Exam 3							TBA			self-scheduled			TBA			



## Course plan ##

Our plan is to cover most of chapters 7, 8, 9, and 10 in the textbook,
and maybe parts of chapter 11 if we have time.
Below is a rough outline of what is to be covered week by week through the semester. 
Please check back regularly for precise details on what is covered,

## Getting help ##

Here are a few ways to get help:     

-   **Office Hours**: <#include officehours.txt>  
-	**Evening TA help**.  Student TA's will hold office hours for the class several nights a week in Clapp.
	TBA are the TAs for our section, but the sections will all cover similar material, 
	so you should feel free to attend others' sessions as well.  
	The evening help schedule is as follows:
	+	**Sundays, 7:00 – 9:00 pm** in TBA with TBA
	+	**Mondays, 7:00 – 9:00 pm** in TBA with TBA
	+	**Tuesdays, 7:00 – 9:00 pm** in TBA with TBA
	+	**Wednesdays, 7:00 – 9:00 pm** in TBA with TBA
	+	**Thursdays, 7:00 – 9:00 pm** in TBA with TBA
-	**Individual tutoring**: There will be some opportunities to meet individually with TAs by appointment (link below).
	+	TBA will hold time TBA in TBA.
		Use [TBA's sign-up page][] to reserve an appointment.
	+	TBA will hold time TBA in TBA.
		Use [TBA2's sign-up page][] to reserve an appointment.
-	**Study groups**: Other students in the class are a wonderful resource.
	I want our class to feel like a community of people working together.  Please get in touch if you'd like me to help you find
	study partners, and please reach out if you'd like others to join your group.
	
## Resources ##

-	[Wolfram Alpha][]: a useful way to check your answers on computations.
	It can do algebra and calculus, among other things, and it understands a mix of English and symbols.
-	[Desmos][]: a nice website for graphing functions.
